# Magento DevDocs infographics library

The libraries and sample files in this repository are for use within [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). 

Currently there are two library files (`diagramming-library.xml` and `icons-library.xml`) and one sample file (`infographics-sample.xml`) for you to use when creating a new graphic for a devdocs topic.

## Usage

The two links below will automatically open a draw.io artboard with both libraries opened for use.
