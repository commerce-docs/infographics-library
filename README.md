# Magento DevDocs infographics library

The libraries and sample files in this repository are for use within [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). 

Currently there is one library file (`devdocs-library.xml`) and one sample file (`infographics-sample.xml`) for you to use when creating a new graphic for a devdocs topic.

## Usage

The starter link below opens draw.io with a blank canvas and loads the devdocs library for use. The sample file link opens, opens draw.io, loads the devdocs library, and opens the sample file on the canvas.
